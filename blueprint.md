# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the design, features, and implementation plan for a modern, web-based chat application. The application will feature a real-time chat interface powered by Google's Gemini API and will be built using React and the Mantine component library.

## Design & Styling

- **Component Library:** Mantine UI
- **Visual Style:** A modern, catchy, and visually stunning design with a focus on a vibrant and energetic look and feel.
- **Color Palette:** A custom theme has been created with a focus on a primary color (ocean blue), along with complementary accent colors (deep space blue) for a vibrant and energetic look.
- **Typography:** Clear and readable fonts are used, with a focus on a clean and modern sans-serif typeface (Inter) and a bold heading font (Roboto).
- **Layout:** A responsive, single-page layout with a header and a main content area, built with Mantine's `AppShell` component.
- **Background:** A subtle noise texture has been added to the background to add a premium, tactile feel.
- **Animations:** New messages fade in with a subtle animation to make the chat feel more dynamic.

## Features

- Real-time chat with a Gemini-powered AI (`gemini-1.5-flash` model).
- A stunning and intuitive user interface with a modern design.
- A responsive design that works on both mobile and web.
- A custom theme to create a unique look and feel.
- Firestore is used for storing and retrieving chat messages in real-time.
- User and bot avatars to create a more personal and engaging chat experience.
- Redesigned chat bubbles with gradients and modern styling.

## Implemented Changes

1.  **Created a custom theme:** Defined a custom color palette and typography in a `src/theme.js` file.
2.  **Updated `App.jsx`:** Created a main layout with a header and a content area for the chat component using `AppShell`, and renamed the application to "OCG AI".
3.  **Updated `main.jsx`:** Applied the custom theme to the entire application using Mantine's `MantineProvider`.
4.  **Refactored `Chat.jsx`:** Rewrote the component to be more robust, with improved error handling, simplified state management, and reliable real-time updates from Firestore.
5.  **Corrected `firebase.js`:** Fixed a critical error where the Firestore database instance was not being exported.
6.  **Updated Gemini Model:** Changed the model name in `Chat.jsx` to `gemini-1.5-flash` to resolve the API error.
7.  **UI/UX Overhaul:** Completely redesigned the chat interface to be more attractive and catchy, with a new theme, redesigned chat bubbles, avatars, background texture, and animations.
